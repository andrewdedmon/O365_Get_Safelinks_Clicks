This is a simple script to grab all safelinks clicks in a domain. Two files are made: one for all clicks, one for blocked clicks only. The files are saved locally and can be easily ingested into a centralized logging platform or queried locally. The files are constantly rewritten so some measure would need to be taken to prevent duplicates in a centralized logging platform (such as tweaking the crcSalt and/or the CHECK_METHOD in Splunk).
